To Do:

Package:
  - finish documentation and testing (what else do we need to do for this?)

Shiny app:
  - create
  - write a function that activates the app from our package
  - see code here for example function:https://github.com/r-lib/vdiffr/blob/master/R/cases-ui.R)
  - have an option for changing the variable on the y-axis
  - have an option for plots to show (could be as tabs)
  - make plots interactive using plotly
  - have an option for residual type
  - could print out observation in a table when point is clicked on the plot

Vignette:
  - write!
  - section on residual types (when to use)
  - section on interpreting all plots
  - section on using the functions (redres, plotting functions, shiny app)
  - example

Other:
  - make a sticker

Completed:
- adjust y axis label in plot_redres to change based on residual type
- add horizontal line through 0 on plot_redres
- set a default theme in all plots (theme_bw)
- change plot_resid documentation examples to use sleepdata
- update errors and warnings in plot_resid
- change all documentation examples to use sleepdata
- KG: maybe provide option for theme - I decided not to do this since we are only
  outputting one figure at a time, so users can actually add their own options
  just like you would with ggplot2.
- KG: proof read through documentation
- KG: updated documentation
- KG: update errors and warnings to give more helpful messages
- KG: updated tests
