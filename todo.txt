--------
To Do
--------

Package:
  - add comments about able to format plots using ggplot2
  - Kellie will finish her documentation
  - Kellie will work on plot_raneff
  - check that there is minimal documentation for all non-exported functions
  - finish documentation for shiny launch function
  - add app function example to readme and roxygen comments

Shiny app:
  - write a function that activates the app from our package
  - see code here for example function:https://github.com/r-lib/vdiffr/blob/master/R/cases-ui.R)
  - have an option for changing the variable on the y-axis
  - have an option for plots to show (could be as tabs)
  - make plots interactive using plotly
  - have an option for residual type
  - could print out observation in a table when point is clicked on the plot

Vignette:
  - write!
  - KG: residual types (except generalized) and notational set-up
  - KG: describe package functions
  - KM: introduction
  - KM: generalized residuals
  - KM: plot quantile functions
  - find data set for example section
  - walk through analysis of data for example section

Presentation:

Katherine
- introduction/motivation
- why it is useful?
- what you can do with it?
- show github page/how to downlaod
- lmer and exisiting methods

Kellie
- introduce and show how to use the redres function
- computation of residual / differences
- why would you want to use the different residuals?

Yudi
- introduce and demonstrate plotting functions (plot_redres, plot_raneff, plot_genres)
- explain how to read the plots
- show how it can be used with ggplot2 formatting functions

Huo
- introduce the redres_app function
- demonstrate Shiny app
- using the app with one model (this person will explain how to use the app in detail)

Jing
- using the app with two (or more) models (this person spends more time demonstrating how to use the app to compare models)
- future work?

Other:
  - make a sticker?
