To Do
--------

Package:

Shiny app:
  - J+YZ+H: figure out how to test the app (maybe could have an error check)

Vignette (use paprika data for whole vignette):
  - KM: introduction
  - KG: residual type section
  - KM: plot section
  - YZ: shiny app

Presentation:

Katherine
- introduction/motivation
- why it is useful?
- what you can do with it?
- show github page/how to downlaod
- lmer and exisiting methods

Kellie
- introduce and show how to use the redres function
- computation of residual / differences
- why would you want to use the different residuals?

Yudi
- introduce and demonstrate plotting functions (plot_redres, plot_raneff, plot_resqq)
- explain how to read the plots
- show how it can be used with ggplot2 formatting functions

Huo
- introduce the redres_app function
- demonstrate Shiny app
- using the app with one model (this person will explain how to use the app in detail)

Jing
- using the app with two (or more) models (this person spends more time demonstrating how to use the app to compare models)
- future work?
