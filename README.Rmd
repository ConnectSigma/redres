# redres

`redres` is an R package developed to help with diagnosing linear mixed models fit using the function `lmer` from the lme4 package. This package both computes residuals types and creates plots that are not available from lme4.

## Installation

`redres` can be installed from the GitHub repository using the devtools package.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Installs redres
devtools::install_github("goodekat/redres")
```

Once installed, the package can be loaded as usual.

```{r}
# Loads the library
library(redres)
```

## Functions 

The package contains the following functions. 

#### redres

`redres` computes residuals given an `lmer` model and a specified residual type. The available residuals types are listed below.

- `"pearson_cond"`: Pearson conditional residuals
- `"pearson_mar"`: Pearson marginal residuals
- `"raw_cond"`: raw conditional residuals (default)
- `"raw_mar"`: raw marginal residuals
- `"std_cond"`: studentized conditional residuals
- `"std_mar"`: studentized marginal residuals

```{r message = FALSE}
# fits an lmer model
library(lme4)
m <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (Days | Subject), data = sleepstudy)

# computes the default residuals (raw conditional)
rc_resids <- redres(m)

# computes the Pearson marginal residuals
pm_resids <- redres(m, type = "pearson_mar")

# computes the studentized conditional residuals
sc_resids <- redres(m, type = "std_cond")

# puts the residuals in a data frame and prints the first six rows
resids <- data.frame(rc_resids, pm_resids, sc_resids)
head(resids)
```

#### plot_resid

`plot_resid` creates a plot (using `ggplot2`) of the residuals versus the fitted values given a model and a specified residual type. All residuals types listed for `redres` work with `plot_resid`.

```{r}
# creates a plot of the conditional studentized residuals versus the fitted values
plot_redres(m, type = "std_cond")
```

#### plot_resqq

`plot_resqq` creates a normal quantile plot (using `ggplot2` and `qqplotr`) of the raw conditional residuals, `raw_cond`. By the assumptions of a model fit using `lmer` these residuals are expected to be normally distributed. Obvious departures indicate an invalid assumption. See [vignette](https://goodekat.github.io/redres/articles/redres-vignette.html) for more details about interpreting quantile plots.

```{r}
# creates a residual quantile plot for the error term
plot_resqq(m)
```


#### plot_ranef

`plot_ranef` creates normal quantile plots for all random effects in the model. Under the assumptions of a `lmer` model, each random effect term is normally distributed. This function will return a grid of plots fit using `ggplot2` and `qqplotr`.

```{r}
# creates normal quantile plots for each random effect
plot_ranef(m)
```

#### redres_app

`redres_app` opens a Shiny app that includes interactive panels to view the diagnostic plots from a model. The function can be used by inputting one or two models into the app in the form of a vector. If two models are input, the residual plots will be shown side by side in the app. Screen shots of the app are shown below.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# opens the app
redres_app(m)
```
