\title{Plot Diagnostic Plots with Residuals}
\usage{
plot_redres(model, type = "raw_cond")
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Model fit using either \code{lm}, \code{glm}, \code{lmer},
\code{redres}.}

\item{type}{Type of residuals to plot. For model \code{lm}, we have
"response", "pearson", "standardized"; for \code{glm}, we have "response",
"pearson", "deviance"; for \code{lmer}, we have "raw_cond", "raw_mar", "pearson_cond",
"pearson_mar", "std_cond", "std_mar", "genres".}
}
\value{
A residual plot.
}
\description{
Residual Plots with multiple residual types choices given a model.
Now have "lm", "glm", "lmer" three kinds of models, except the residual
types included in those models, we also have other residual types, such as
conditional residual, generalized residual and standrized residual.
}
\examples{
# Fit a linear mixed effect model with a default (raw conditional) residual type.
library(lme4)
fm1 <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (Days | Subject), sleepstudy)
plot_redres(fm1)
# Fit a linear mixed effect model with a conditional residual type.
plot_redres(fm1, type = "raw_cond")
}
