\title{Shiny App for 'redressing' linear mixed models}
\usage{
redres_app(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Model fit using \code{lmer} function from lme4 package.}
}
\description{
This is a shiny app for model diagnoistic of mixed model using \code{lmer} function from lme4 package.
This app includes residual plot computed from six types of residuals (conditional raw, Pearson, and
studentized, marginal raw, Pearson, and studentized) and normal quantile plot using of random effect
and error term. This app can also be used to do model selection through pairwise comparison
two models from different linear mixed models using lmer function.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# fits a linear mixed effects model
library(lme4)
fm1 <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (Days | Subject), data = sleepstudy)
redres_app(model = fm1)
# comparing two different linear mixed effects models
fm1 <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (Days | Subject), data = sleepstudy)
fm2 <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (1|Subject) + (0+Days|Subject), sleepstudy)
cmbd <- c(fm1,fm2)
redres_app(model = cmbd)
}
